# Glow

This is a theme that was largely inspired by the Eva theme by 
[fisheva](https://github.com/fisheva/Eva-Theme). A lot of the color theory in the
dark theme is the same, but practically all of the colors have been redone to 
make the theme more vibrant.


## Glow Deep

This is the dark theme for this package, centered around the deep blue-gray background
as opposed to the warmer gray that is used in practically every default dark theme that
you see. The color scheme is meant to be reminiscent of glowing Jellyfish in the ocean.
Here is a pretty screenshot!

## Glow Dusk 

This is a slightly lighter, lower contrast version of the Glow Deep theme. The colors
are muted and the colors are modified to look a bit more like city lights at dusk.

## Glow Gems

This is a "light" theme for dark theme enthusiasts. The background is an 80% gray meant to
look like platinum, and the colors are largely inspired by the colors of gemstones.

## Glow Balloon

This is a light theme that is meant to be a counterpart to Glow Deep. Instead of being
based on Jellyfish in the deep, the color scheme is designed to look like balloons floating
in the sky. Most importantly, the theme is NOT just the Glow Deep theme with the background
switched to white (switching to white NOT suddenly make your theme a light theme!). A
screenshot!

## Glow Flower

This is another light theme much in the same vein as Balloon. This time, the colors
are a bit more muted (if only slighly) compared to the other color themes, and the colors
themselves are inspired by flower fields.
